# Data Analysis Portfolio for Constructor.io
This portfolio showcases selected data analytics projects that leverage Python, SQL, and analytical libraries to support data-driven decision-making and generate actionable business insights, with a strong focus on e-commerce, sales, and revenue impact.

### Project 1: Brazilian E-commerce sales and marketing funnel Analysis
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Olist, a Brazilian B2B e-commerce platform that enables sellers to operate across online marketplaces using a unified solution.

The analysis explores the marketing and sales funnel, connecting lead-level data with downstream seller performance to uncover factors that drive conversion and revenue.

Key components include:
- SQL-based EDA using DuckDB over a multi-table schema
- Data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Folium for geospatial insights
- Generation of actionable business insights to support sales and decision-making

### Project 2: Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project uses PySpark to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models aimed at identifying customers likely to churn. Beyond prediction, the analysis focuses on understanding key drivers of churn and translating them into potential business actions.

The models used are:
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)

The project covers core stages of the analytics lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation, and visualization-driven insights with final business recommendations.
